# Mental-Health-Is-Important

## Description
The goal behind this is to get me comfortable sharing code, accepting feedback as well as any constructive criticism. 
This is something random I thought of to get me out of the shell, mental health is a huge factor in my life; so
what better than a simple program to remind me to take breaks every once in a while. I find that I spend way too much
time on one thing without breaks and burn myself out very quickly. 


## Usage 
Adjust the time.sleep(int) for your optimal time you'd like to set for these reminders. Its purpose is to be repetitive.


## How to Contribute

If anyone has any sort of interest in contributing to this, please feel free to do so. If any feedback on how it could be 
more efficient as well as any constructive criticism is very much so encouraged.
